// Bitwise Shifting Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bitwise shifting and rotation operations
// It serves as the foundation for bit manipulation and arithmetic operations

// This file acts as the entry point for the bitwise shifting system
// It will import and organize all the bitwise shifting functionality

// Import the basic bitwise shifting operations
pub mod bitwise_shifting;

// Import the advanced bitwise shifting operations
pub mod bitwise_shifting_advanced;

// Re-export commonly used bitwise shifting operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual functions
