// Bitwise Arithmetic Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bitwise arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, modulo)
// It is organized into basic operations and advanced operations

// Import the basic bitwise arithmetic operations
pub mod bitwise_arithmetic;

// Import the advanced bitwise arithmetic operations
pub mod bitwise_arithmetic_advanced;

// Re-export commonly used bitwise arithmetic operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual functions
