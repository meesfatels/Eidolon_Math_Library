// Bitwise Arithmetic Operations for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains ultra-low-level implementations of fundamental bitwise arithmetic operations
// All functions are implemented using Rust's highly optimized built-in operators for maximum performance
// Supporting all numeric types: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize

// Import necessary standard library components for low-level operations
use std::ops::{Add, Sub, Mul, Div, Rem};

/// Performs bitwise addition between two values of generic type T
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `a` - The first operand for the addition operation
/// * `b` - The second operand for the addition operation
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `T` - The result of the addition operation
/// 
/// # Implementation Details
/// This function uses Rust's built-in addition operator (`+`) which is:
/// 1. Highly optimized by the Rust compiler
/// 2. Compiled to the most efficient CPU instructions (often ADD)
/// 3. Automatically optimized for different architectures
/// 4. Handles all numeric types uniformly and safely
/// 5. Provides consistent performance across platforms
/// 6. Automatically handles overflow and underflow cases
/// 
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - Zero heap allocations
/// - Minimal stack usage
/// - Optimized for modern CPU architectures
/// - Hardware-accelerated when possible
/// - Cache-friendly memory access patterns
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
