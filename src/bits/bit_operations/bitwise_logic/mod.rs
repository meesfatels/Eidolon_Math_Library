// Bitwise Logic Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bitwise logical operations (AND, OR, XOR, NOT)
// It is organized into basic operations and advanced operations

// Import the basic bitwise logic operations
pub mod bitwise_logic;

// Import the advanced bitwise logic operations
pub mod bitwise_logic_advanced;

// Re-export commonly used bitwise logic operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual functions
