// Bitwise Logic Advanced Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains advanced bitwise logic operations that go beyond
// the basic functionality provided in the main bitwise_logic module

// Import the advanced AND operations
pub mod bitwise_logic_and;

// Import the advanced OR operations
pub mod bitwise_logic_or;

// Import the advanced XOR operations
pub mod bitwise_logic_xor;

// Import the advanced NOT operations
pub mod bitwise_logic_not;

// Import other related functions that don't use core functions as a base
pub mod other_related;

// Re-export commonly used advanced bitwise logic operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual advanced functions
