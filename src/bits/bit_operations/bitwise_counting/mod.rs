// Bitwise Counting Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bitwise counting operations (population count, leading/trailing zeros, etc.)
// It is organized into basic operations and advanced operations

// Import the basic bitwise counting operations
pub mod bitwise_counting;

// Import the advanced bitwise counting operations
pub mod bitwise_counting_advanced;

// Re-export commonly used bitwise counting operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual functions
