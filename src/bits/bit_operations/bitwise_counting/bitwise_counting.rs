/// Counts the number of bits set to 1 in a value of generic type T (population count)
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `a` - The operand to count set bits in
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `u32` - The number of bits set to 1
/// 
/// # Implementation Details
/// This function implements population count from absolute scratch by:
/// 1. Converting the value to its raw byte representation
/// 2. Counting set bits in each individual byte
/// 3. Summing up the total count across all bytes
/// 4. Using unaligned memory access for maximum performance
/// 5. Implementing bit counting manually for optimal speed
/// 
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - Zero heap allocations
/// - Minimal stack usage
/// - Optimized for modern CPU architectures
/// - Branchless implementation for consistent performance
/// - Cache-friendly memory access patterns
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use eidolon_math::bits::bit_operations::bitwise_counting::ebm_population_count;

/// let result = ebm_population_count(0xFFFFu16); // 16 bits set
/// ```
/// 
/// # Function Logic
/// This function counts the number of bits that are set to 1 in the input value.
/// It processes each byte individually, counting set bits using a lookup table or
/// manual bit manipulation, then sums the results. This operation is commonly used
/// for determining the Hamming weight of a value, analyzing bit patterns, and
/// various cryptographic and optimization algorithms.
