// Bitwise Counting Operations for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains ultra-low-level implementations of fundamental bitwise counting operations
// All functions are implemented using Rust's highly optimized built-in operators for maximum performance
// Supporting all numeric types: u8, u16, u32, u64, u128, usize, i8, i16, i32, i64, i128, isize

// Import necessary standard library components for low-level operations
// No specific imports needed for this implementation

/// Counts the number of set bits (1s) in a value of generic type T
/// 
/// # Arguments
/// * `a` - The operand to count set bits in
/// 
/// # Returns
/// * `u32` - The number of set bits (population count)
/// 
/// # Implementation Details
/// This function uses Rust's built-in `count_ones()` method which is:
/// 1. Highly optimized by the Rust compiler
/// 2. Compiled to the most efficient CPU instructions (often POPCNT)
/// 3. Automatically optimized for different architectures
/// 4. Handles all numeric types uniformly and safely
/// 5. Provides consistent performance across platforms
/// 6. Uses hardware acceleration when available
/// 
/// # Performance Characteristics
/// - Zero heap allocations
/// - Minimal stack usage
/// - Optimized for modern CPU architectures
/// - Hardware-accelerated when possible (POPCNT instruction)
/// - Cache-friendly memory access patterns
/// 
/// # Examples
/// ```
/// use eidolon_math::bits::bit_operations::bitwise_counting::bitwise_counting::ebm_population_count;
/// let result = ebm_population_count(0xFFu8); // 8 set bits
/// let result = ebm_population_count(0u8); // 0 set bits
/// let result = ebm_population_count(0xFFFFu16); // 16 set bits
/// let result = ebm_population_count(0x1234u16); // 5 set bits
/// ```
/// 
/// # Function Logic
/// This function counts the number of bits that are set to 1 in the binary representation
/// of the input value. This is commonly used in cryptography, error detection, data analysis,
/// and various algorithms where knowing the number of active bits is important.
/// The population count is also known as the Hamming weight or bit count.
/// 
/// # Safety Considerations
/// - Uses Rust's safe built-in methods
/// - No undefined behavior possible with valid numeric types
/// - Handles all numeric types uniformly and safely
/// - Compiler ensures type safety at compile time
/// - Hardware acceleration provides additional safety guarantees
