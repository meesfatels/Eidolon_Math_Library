// Bitwise Counting Advanced Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains advanced bitwise counting operations that go beyond
// the basic functionality provided in the main bitwise_counting module

// Import the advanced leading counting operations
pub mod bitwise_counting_leading;

// Import the advanced trailing counting operations
pub mod bitwise_counting_trailing;

// Import the advanced population counting operations
pub mod bitwise_counting_population;

// Import other related functions that don't use core functions as a base
pub mod other_related;

// Re-export commonly used advanced bitwise counting operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we implement the actual advanced functions
