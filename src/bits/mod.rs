// Bits System Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bit-level mathematical operations and manipulations
// It serves as the foundation for higher-level mathematical operations

// This file acts as the entry point for the bits system
// It will import and organize all the bit-related functionality

// TODO: Import specific bit operation modules as they are created
// Example: pub mod basic_operations;
// Example: pub mod rotation;
// Example: pub mod counting;
// Example: pub mod manipulation;

// Re-export commonly used bit operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we create the actual bit operation modules
