// Bits System Module for Eidolon Math Library
// This module contains all bit-level mathematical operations and manipulations
// It serves as the foundation for higher-level mathematical operations

// This file acts as the entry point for the bits system
// It will import and organize all the bit-related functionality

// Import the bit operations module (temporarily commented out due to compilation issues)
// pub mod bit_operations;

// Re-export commonly used bit operations for easy access
// This will be populated as we create the actual bit operation modules
